# Memory Stage

## LSU (Load Store Unit)

In RISC-V core, the Load Store Unit (LSU) is a critical pipeline component responsible for controlling load and store instructions and handling various error conditions, particularly address misalignment. The LSU acts as an interface between the processor's execution stage and the Memory Management Unit (MMU), ensuring proper data transfer, address calculation, and exception handling.

### Design Principle

- **LSU Queue:** The `LSU` implement internal queue to store all necessary dtat for memory operactions. 

- **Address Misaligned:** In this part, we want LSU detect misaligned error and solve it. Therefore, we need to record every condition, including memory addresses, data values, instruction types, and control signals.

- **Writeback Data Calculation:** This part is for load instruction. In our design, lsu will sent read word signal to mmu even if instruction is `WB` or `WH`. Therefore, it needs caculate word data after lsu get terget data.

### Implement Detail

#### Parameter

|Parameter  |Description                            |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
|LENGTH     |Queue length parameter                 |
|DEPTH      |Queue depth parameter                  |
|DATASIZE   |Internal data size for queue operations|

#### Address and Data Procressing

**Address:** LSU will control address which will be sent into MMU be mutipler of 4. **Data:** LSU use `mask` to control which byte of write data are needed to be writen into memory.

#### LSU Queue

Action:

- Push: input instruction is valid, and misaligned condition.
- Pop: when memory return finished signal.

Input Data:

|Signal                     |Width |Description            |
|---------------------------|------|-----------------------|
|mem_addr                   |32    |Target memory address  |
|mem_data                   |32    |value of write data    |
|lb_inst, lh_inst, lw_inst  |1     |Load instruction type|
|signed_inst                |1     |load instruction is signed |
|mem_rd, mem_wr             |1     |memory read and write signal|
|mem_mask                   |4     |store or load mask|
|u_type                     |1     |additional instruction for misaligned problem|

#### Address Misaligned

The LSU includes sophisticated misalignment detection and correction logic. When misaligned memory accesses are detected, the LSU automatically:

- Splits the misaligned access into multiple aligned memory transactions
- Maintains state information across multiple memory cycles
- Reconstructs the final result from partial memory responses
- Ensures atomicity of the original memory operation from an architectural perspective

The LSU handles unaligned memory accesses by splitting them into multiple aligned accesses:

- **Unaligned Detection**
    - Half-word unaligned: Address bits [1:0] = 2'b11
    - Word unaligned: Address bits [1:0] â‰  2'b00

- **Unaligned Access Handling:** Maintains state machine (u_state) for multi-cycle unaligned operations. Then, automatically generates second memory access for unaligned transfers.Finally, reconstructs data from multiple memory responses in writeback calculation.

#### Writeback Value Calculation

For load instructions, the LSU performs intelligent data processing since it always requests full 32-bit words from the MMU regardless of the actual load instruction type (LB, LH, LW). The writeback calculation unit:

Extracts the relevant bytes from the loaded word based on address and instruction type
Performs sign extension or zero extension as required
Handles data reconstruction for misaligned accesses
Manages the timing of writeback operations to the register file

#### Exception Handling

In this part, LSU will receive signal `load_fault` and `store_fault` which is sended from MMU. Then, generates exceptions:

## MMU (Memory Management Unit)

In RISC-V core, MMU is responsible to translate virtual address into physical address. The translaction process needs some units to help MMU.

- Cache Control Unit
- Table Lookagead Buffer
- Page Table Walker

### Virtual Memory

We use Sv32 as our virtual address design. Sv32 use two-level page to translate virtual address into physical address. This is its virtual address structure:

|31 - 22               |21 - 12                |11 - 0|
|----------------------|-----------------------|------|
|First Level Page Index|Second Level Page Index|Offset|

**SATP (Supervisor Address Translation and Protection):** It is a register to store virtual address information and control page management, and it maintain by `CSR`. This is Satp structure:

|31     |30 - 22    |19 - 0 |
|-------|-----------|-------|
|MODE   |ASID       |PPN    |

- MODE: virtual address support in current.
- ASID: address space identifier to control that address can be used in current process.
- PPN: first level physical page number.

### Design Principle

- **Table Lookahead Buffer (TLB):** TLB store a history data of pages. It returns value if page was requested, or sent request signal into TLB to find correct page and its data.

- **Page Table Walker (PTW):** PTW can find the correct page with page index of virtual address and calculate physical address by page data. Then, page fault exceptions also are detected in this unit.

- **Cache Interaction:** this unit is used to control signal of cache interaction.

### Implement Detail

#### TLB

Use two register to store page value, and it compares input virtual page number and `vpn_q`. If TLB hit, TLB will return page value directly. Otherwise, MMU will start PTW to find target page and update TLB data.

|Register   |Width  |Description        |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
|vpn_q      |20     |virtual page number|
|entry_q    |32     |page entry data    |

#### PTW

Page table walker (PTW) can search page table and detect page errror condition. In our virtual address design, we use two level page to translate virtual address into physical address. Therefore, PTW use four state finite state machine to control procession of searching page. Four state include:

|State          |Description                 |
|---------------|----------------------------|
|IDLE           |wait MMU start PTW          |
|FIRST_LEVEL    |search first level page     |
|SECOND_LEVEL   |search second level page    |
|UPDATE         |get page data and update TLB|
